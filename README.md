# Overview

This program was written in Swift. I wrote an event data base that is able to utilize object oriented programming to store different events.
It is also able to display things like the total event count, and the nearest event to today.

I wrote this software in Swift to demonstrate my ability to not only code in the language, but effectively use systems like object oriented
programming.
